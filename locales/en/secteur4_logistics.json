          "question": "What is Smart Logistics?",
          "answer": "Smart Logistics, or intelligent logistics, refers to the integration of digital technologies such as IoT, AI, cloud and connectivity into logistics processes. It enables real-time flow management, better goods traceability, resource optimization and decision-making based on reliable data."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What are the benefits of Smart Logistics for my business?",
          "answer": "Thanks to Smart Logistics, you can:<br />- Reduce costs related to transport and inventory management<br />- Minimize human errors and stock shortages<br />- Improve delivery times and customer satisfaction<br />- Anticipate logistics disruptions through predictive analysis<br />- Gain competitiveness in the market"
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How does Smart Logistics improve traceability?",
          "answer": "With IoT sensors, QR codes, or RFID technologies, each product can be tracked in real time throughout the logistics chain. This allows you to:<br />- Know the exact location of a package<br />- React quickly in case of loss or delay<br />- Ensure compliance with safety or health standards"
