            "q1_title": "What is Smart Aquaculture?",
            "q1_body": "Smart Aquaculture refers to the integration of sensors, cloud solutions, and artificial intelligence into aquaculture operations. This approach allows for remote monitoring and control of environmental parameters, species behavior, feeding, and many other key aspects of farming.",
            "q2_title": "Why adopt a Smart Aquaculture solution?",
            "q2_body": "Thanks to an intelligent platform, you can:\n- Monitor water quality in real-time\n- Automate feeding according to the actual needs of the fish\n- Reduce losses related to diseases and extreme conditions\n- Improve animal welfare\n- Anticipate deviations through predictive analysis\n- Ensure compliance with health and environmental standards",
            "q3_title": "What data can be collected on a connected aquaculture farm?",
            "q3_body": "Here are a few examples:\n- Water temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen\n- Turbidity and levels of ammonia or nitrates\n- Real-time weather data (rain, wind, solar radiation)\n- Fish behavior (through cameras or tags)\n- Quantity of feed distributed and actual consumption",
            "q4_title": "Is Smart Aquaculture suitable for all types of farms?",
            "q4_body": "Yes, it can be applied to various contexts:\n- Marine aquaculture (offshore, sea cages)\n- Freshwater aquaculture (tanks, ponds)\n- Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS)\n- Fish or mollusk farms",
            "q5_title": "How does remote monitoring work in a smart farm?",
            "q5_body": "Sensors installed on-site continuously transmit data to an online platform via the network (4G/5G, LoRa, Wi-Fi). Farmers can view this data in real-time on a dashboard, receive alerts in case of anomalies, and access historical data to analyze trends and make informed decisions.",
            "q6_title": "Can fish feeding be automated with Smart Aquaculture?",
            "q6_body": "Absolutely. Automatic systems can adjust the quantity and timing of distribution based on:\n- Fish behavior\n- Their growth rate\n- Water quality. This helps maximize growth while avoiding waste.",
            "q7_title": "Is the implementation complicated and expensive?",
            "q7_body": "No. Solutions are increasingly modular and accessible. a project can start small (with a few key sensors) and then evolve progressively. Moreover, the return on investment is rapid thanks to the reduction of losses, feed costs, and improved productivity."
