        "q1": {
          "question": "What are the main networks for connecting an object?",
          "answer": "Regarding data transmission, several types of networks can be used depending on needs. Here are the main ones:\n\n- LAN (Local Area Network) networks: such as RFID, BLE or Zigbee, they offer short range (between 1 and 100 meters) while consuming little energy. They work like a private network, similar to that of your home or business.\n\n- PAN (Personal Area Network) networks: with an even more restricted range (only a few meters), like Bluetooth, they allow communication between personal equipment in immediate proximity.\n\n- WAN (Wide Area Network) networks: they offer a more extended range, up to several tens of meters, and allow connecting devices over greater distances.\n\n- LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks: notably LoRa and Sigfox, specifically designed for IoT, they combine long range, low energy consumption and reduced cost, making them a particularly suitable solution for many use cases.\n\n- Satellite networks: available everywhere in the world (for example GPS), they guarantee connectivity even in the most isolated areas.\n\n- Cellular networks: GSM, 2G, 3G, 4G allow transporting large volumes of data over long distances with excellent coverage, although they are relatively energy-consuming."
        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "Which networks according to use cases?",
          "answer": "Here are some examples of uses associated with certain types of networks:\n- For a network printer in the office, prefer the LAN network;\n- Same for connected refrigerators (for the cold chain) or air conditioning, with the aim of regulating energy consumption.\n- For a connected bulb, socket, switch, it is appropriate to use the PAN network;\n- To connect parking spaces in a shopping center, the LPWAN network is preferred;\n- Same as for monitoring air quality in a classroom or remote reading of water meters and managing the risk of legionella in collective hot water.\n- Finally, for transporting goods in containers by sea, the network choice is satellite."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "How does data transit in an IoT project?",
          "answer": "The data path in IoT is done in several stages. It is first collected using an IoT sensor which transmits it to an antenna (or router). This antenna serves as a relay and leads the data to a data warehouse in the Cloud to be able to store it. Once analyzed and interpreted, the data is returned in a so-called \"intelligent\" way and made available on dedicated data visualization interfaces.\n\nIt is important to know that networks can be short range (from a few centimeters to a few meters), or long range (from tens of meters to several kilometers)."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "What is the purpose of a private APN?",
          "answer": "Don't forget to secure data flows with Private APN:\n\nThe private APN (Access Point Name) allows you to communicate with the fleet of SIM transmitters without going through the internet. Thus connections are controlled and security is reinforced."
        },
        "q5": {
          "question": "5 good reasons to choose LoRaWAN technology to connect your sensor?",
          "answer": "The definition of LoRaWAN is \"Long Range Wide – Area Network\", which translates to \"Extended Long Range Network\" in English. We also talk about LoRa technology which means \"Long range\".\n\nThe LoRaWAN standard, based on LoRa technology, has many advantages to efficiently connect a wide variety of objects requiring high autonomy and low information feedback in volume.\n\n1. It is bidirectional, which allows sensors to emit information but also to receive it.\n\n2. It allows to geolocate objects, without needing GPS embedded in the objects.\n\n3. Energy consumption optimization allows objects to have greater autonomy, as it is a low-energy network.\n\n4. LoRaWAN™ is an open standard that allows interoperability between heterogeneous sensors and systems.\n\n5. It is particularly suitable for smart cities that want to deploy their own private infrastructure or for industrial sectors."

        "q6": {
          "question": "What is the difference between an M2M SIM and a phone SIM?",
          "answer": "Phone SIM cards and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) SIMs both aim to connect devices to cellular networks, but their uses and functionalities differ profoundly.\n\nTraditional SIMs are intended for consumer use, mainly for voice communications, sending SMS and internet access on smartphones, tablets or other personal terminals.\n\nConversely, M2M SIMs are designed for professional and industrial applications, particularly in the Internet of Things (IoT) field. They allow automatic connection of equipment and sensors without human intervention, while being adapted to extreme usage conditions and long-term connectivity needs, whether equipment is fixed or mobile.\n\nTheir main advantage lies in their centralized management via specialized web platforms, offering remote control of the entire fleet of SIM cards and connected equipment. These platforms also offer advanced diagnostic tools and simplified integration via API.\n\nTo strengthen security, M2M SIMs frequently use private networks (APN) and often integrate multi-operator capability to guarantee service continuity, regardless of location. They are now essential in sectors such as industry, building, security, connected health or local authorities. Finally, M2M subscriptions are generally offered in the form of pooled or modular packages, to better adapt to different use cases."
