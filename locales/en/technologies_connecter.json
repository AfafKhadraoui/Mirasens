            "subtitle": "We answer all your questions!",
            "q1_title": "What are the main networks for connecting a device?",
            "q1_body": "Regarding data transmission, several types of networks can be used depending on the needs. Here are the main ones:\n\n- LAN (Local Area Network): such as RFID, BLE, or Zigbee, they offer a short range (between 1 and 100 meters) while consuming little power. They function as a private network, similar to your home or office network.\n\n- PAN (Personal Area Network): with an even shorter range (only a few meters), like Bluetooth, they allow communication between personal devices in immediate proximity.\n\n- WAN (Wide Area Network): they offer a wider range, up to several tens of meters, and allow for connecting devices over greater distances.\n\n- LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network): notably LoRa and Sigfox, specifically designed for IoT, they combine long-range, low power consumption, and low cost, making them a particularly suitable solution for many use cases.\n\n- Satellite networks: available worldwide (e.g., GPS), they guarantee connectivity even in the most remote areas.\n\n- Cellular networks: GSM, 2G, 3G, 4G can carry large volumes of data over long distances with excellent coverage, although they are relatively power-intensive.",
            "q2_title": "Which networks for which use cases?",
            "q2_body": "Here are some examples of uses associated with certain types of networks:\n- For a networked printer in the office, prefer the LAN network;\n- The same goes for connected refrigerators (for the cold chain) or air conditioning, in order to regulate energy consumption.\n- For a connected light bulb, outlet, or switch, it is appropriate to use the PAN network;\n- To connect parking spaces in a shopping center, the LPWAN network is preferred;\n- The same applies to monitoring the air quality of a classroom or for remote reading of water meters and managing the risk of legionella in collective hot water.\n- Finally, for transporting goods in containers by sea, the choice of network is satellite.",
            "q3_title": "How does data travel in an IoT project?",
            "q3_body": "The data path in IoT occurs in several stages. It is first collected by an IoT sensor which transmits it to an antenna (or a router). This antenna acts as a relay and sends the data to a data warehouse in the Cloud for storage. Once analyzed and interpreted, the data is returned in a so-called 'intelligent' way and made available on dedicated data visualization interfaces.\n\nIt is important to know that networks can be short-range (from a few centimeters to a few meters), or long-range (from tens of meters to several kilometers).",
            "q4_title": "What is a private APN for?",
            "q4_body": "Don't forget to secure data flows with a Private APN:\n\nA private APN (Access Point Name) allows you to communicate with your fleet of SIM transmitters without going through the internet. This way, connections are controlled and security is enhanced.",
            "q5_title": "5 good reasons to choose LoRaWAN technology to connect your sensor?",
            "q5_body": "The definition of LoRaWAN is 'Long Range Wide-Area Network'. We also talk about LoRa technology which means 'Long Range'.\n\nThe LoRaWAN standard, based on LoRa technology, has many advantages for efficiently connecting a wide variety of objects requiring long battery life and low volume data transmission.\n\n1. It is bidirectional, which allows sensors to send information as well as receive it.\n\n2. It allows for the geolocation of objects, without the need for an embedded GPS in the devices.\n\n3. The optimization of energy consumption allows objects to have a longer battery life, as it is a low-power network.\n\n4. LoRaWANâ„¢ is an open standard that allows interoperability between heterogeneous sensors and systems.\n\n5. It is particularly suitable for smart cities wishing to deploy their own private infrastructure or for industrial sectors.",
            "q6_title": "What is the difference between an M2M SIM and a phone SIM?",
            "q6_body": "Both phone SIM cards and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) SIMs are intended to connect devices to cellular networks, but their uses and functionalities differ profoundly.\n\nTraditional SIMs are for consumer use, mainly for voice communications, sending SMS, and accessing the Internet on smartphones, tablets, or other personal devices.\n\nConversely, M2M SIMs are designed for professional and industrial applications, especially in the Internet of Things (IoT) field. They allow for the automatic connection of equipment and sensors without human intervention, while being adapted to extreme usage conditions and long-term connectivity needs, whether the equipment is fixed or mobile.\n\nTheir main advantage lies in their centralized management via specialized web platforms, offering remote control of the entire fleet of SIM cards and connected equipment. These platforms also offer advanced diagnostic tools and simplified integration via API.\n\nTo enhance security, M2M SIMs frequently use private networks (APNs) and often include multi-operator capability to ensure service continuity, regardless of location. They are now essential in sectors such as industry, construction, security, connected health, and local authorities. Finally, M2M subscriptions are generally offered in the form of pooled or flexible plans, to better adapt to different use cases."

But a project cannot succeed without suitable connectivity, and it must be right from the project's inception. But how do you choose this connectivity? It's true that there are a multitude of connectivity options, and each has very specific characteristics. LoRa, Sigfox, Bluetooth, Wifi, NB-IoT, LTE-M, cellular, RFIDâ€¦ When you're not an expert, it's difficult to navigate and make the right choices. And above all, don't forget: a project is meant to evolve. This means that connectivity that is suitable for today's needs may not be tomorrow. You are an expert in your field, and we are in ours.
