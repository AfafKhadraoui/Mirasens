        "body": "IoT brings together technologies that connect objects via the Internet to make them ‘smart’. For example, connecting a bus to show waiting times, a parking lot to track occupancy, a classroom to check air quality, a fleet to optimize delivery routes, a truck to know the location of its goods, a building to optimize energy consumption, or a green space to manage watering according to the weather. These data help businesses and communities make better decisions, improve daily life, and reduce environmental impact."
