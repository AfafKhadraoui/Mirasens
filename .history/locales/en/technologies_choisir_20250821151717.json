Capturing data is the first step in the process toward processing and then leveraging it. The more data is collected, the more precise the analysis will be.",
            "full": "Data collection obviously aims to improve processes, structure, and the overall organization of an entity. For example, a manufacturer in industry can, thanks to sensors placed on its equipment, monitor the operational status of its fleet, provide insights on how it evolves over time in a given environment, and anticipate malfunctions that machines might encounter."
